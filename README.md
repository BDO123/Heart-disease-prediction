# Heart-disease-prediction
INTRODUCTION :-<br/>
It is a heart disease prediction system using different algorithms of machine learning.
It predicts the condition of patients of heart disease.
It uses only those inputs which is non-medical like Age,Sex,heart rate,chest pain etc.
Its predicted value is 0 or 1, which tell about angiographic disease status as<br/>
    -- Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing <br/>
    -- Value 1: > 50% diameter narrowing <br/>
    
Motivation: <br/>
Heart diseases which is also known as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). <br/>
  Key facts :  (data is taken from https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)   ) <br/>
->CVDs are the number 1 cause of death globally: more people die annually from CVDs than from any other cause.
->An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% are due to heart       attack and stroke.<br/>
->Over three quarters of CVD deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries.<br/>
->Out of the 17 million premature deaths (under the age of 70) due to noncommunicable diseases in 2015, 82% are in low- and middle-income     countries, and 37% are caused by CVDs.<br/>
->Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity,       physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.<br/>
->People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as         hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management using counselling and           medicines, as appropriate.<br/>
